# Vue-Node-Express-MongoDB Decoupled Todos

## Project Overview

This project is a decoupled application with a Node.js and Express.js backend, MongoDB for the database, and a Vue.js frontend. It provides a complete solution for managing todo items through a RESTful API and a user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure

### Backend (`node-express-mongodb-todo-rest-api`)
- `.git/` - Git configuration and history for version control.
- `.gitignore` - Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
- `app.js` - Main application file.
- `package-lock.json` - Describes the exact dependency tree.
- `package.json` - Contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.
- `README.md` - Documentation file.

### Frontend (`vue-decoupled-frontend-todo`)
- `.git/` - Git configuration and history for version control.
- `scripts/` - Contains JavaScript files.
  - `app.js` - Main script file.
  - `todos.js` - Script file related to todo functionalities.
- `styles/` - Contains CSS files.
  - `main.css` - Main stylesheet.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB**

### Frontend
- **Vue.js**

## Backend

### `package.json`
This file lists the project's dependencies and scripts. Key dependencies might include Express.js and MongoDB drivers.

### `app.js`
This is the main entry point for the backend application. It sets up the Express server, connects to MongoDB, and defines the routes for the API.

### REST API Endpoints
- `GET /todos` - Retrieve all todos.
- `POST /todos` - Create a new todo.
- `PUT /todos/:id` - Update a todo by ID.
- `DELETE /todos/:id` - Delete a todo by ID.

## Frontend

### `app.js`
This script initializes the Vue.js application and sets up components and routes.

### `todos.js`
This script contains the logic for managing todos, such as fetching, creating, updating, and deleting todos via the backend API.

### `main.css`
This stylesheet contains the styles for the application, ensuring it looks clean and user-friendly.

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- MongoDB installed and running.

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `node-express-mongodb-todo-rest-api` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `node app.js` to start the server.

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `vue-decoupled-frontend-todo` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if a `package.json` exists).
3. Run the development server using a command like `npm run serve` (typical for Vue.js projects).

## Additional Notes
- **Environment Variables**: The backend might require environment variables for configuration, such as database connection strings. These would typically be defined in a `.env` file.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure that both frontend and backend have proper error handling for a smooth user experience.
- **Security**: Consider implementing authentication and authorization for the API endpoints to secure the todo data.
